# # Part 1: Reduce dimension to 2
# Here, we wish to reduce the data dimensionality from 784 to 2 using Linear Disicriminant Analysis (LDA).
# For this you can use scikit-learn. The LDA class in scikit-learn fits a covariance matrix and compute eigenvectors for you. LDA assume that you know about the classes, so you have to use the concatenated training set and targets/classes.

# # Part 2: Perform 3-class classification based on the generated 2-dimensional data.
# We need to find a model to classify the test data as either 5, 6, or 8.
# Here, we could use a Gaussian model for each class, and estimate the mean and covariance from the dimensionality reduced data.

# Now that the PCA model is fit to the training data, we can find a low dimesional representation of each class.
